# coursera-ml-specialization
An alternate implementation of Machine Learning exercises in Scikit-learn and pandas from Coursera's ML specialization class by University of Washington.

[https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning)

The original class is taught with Graphlab (dato) and SFrame. I have only included the exercises and hands-on session. You are advised to solve the assignments on your own.
